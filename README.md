# AutoAutoComplete

@material-ui/labs/Autocomplete already offers good functionality when you want an autocomplete select component with multiselect option.

I have extended its funtionality by customizing it a little bit so that we can

1. Select an autocomplete from list of available autocompletes.
2. The selected autocomplete appears as a chip and also an autcomplete which will have a list of options to choose from.
3. We can also choose a date option and it will show a chip with a date picker on it.

A sample screenshot looks like below:
